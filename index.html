      <h1>Second div</h1>
      <p>In this div we can see other html tags come into play and also a link to the next page</p>
      <p><strong>This text is in a strong tag</strong> strong tags are used to make text bold but also as an accessability tag for people using text to speech programs - it's read more strongly.</p>
      <p><b>This text is just bold</b> using the b tags we can make text bold without the accessability feature. this is lass recomended.</p>
    </div>
    <p>lastly a link tag to the next page where we'll see lists and tables:</p>
    <a href="page2.html">Link to page 2</a>
